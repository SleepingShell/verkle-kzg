This repository hosts a library that provides a VectorCommitment and several vector commitment scheme implementations, and a verkle tree implementation.

The verkle tree is similar to a merkle tree in that it is a tree structure that commits to its children, but instead of using hashes to provide binding, it uses a vector commitment scheme. The verkle tree itself is also a vector commitment scheme.
